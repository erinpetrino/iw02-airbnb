Η πάλαι ποτέ αρχόντισσα της Αθήνας, η περιοχή με τα νεοκλασικά, τα πάρκα, την πολυπολιτισμική κουλτούρα. Δεν είναι τυχαίο μάλιστα το γεγονός πως πριν λίγο καιρό, η διεθνής έκδοση του περιοδικού ‘Time Out‘ την συμπεριέλαβε στη λίστα με τις 50 πιο cool γειτονιές του πλανήτη, δίνοντάς της μάλιστα την ιδιαίτερα τιμητική 16η θέση. <br />Αυτή η γειτονιά είχε ανέκαθεν μια καλλιτεχνική αύρα. Η Φωκίωνος Νέγρη μάζευε πάντα και όλους τους bon vivants της εποχής, οι οποίοι κατέβαιναν μια βόλτα για να απολαύσουν έναν καλό καφέ ή να πιουν ένα ποτό σε κάποιο μαγαζί. Έδωσε έμπνευση για ταινίες του κινηματογράφου όπως ‘Μια Ιταλίδα από την Κυψέλη’, ‘Ο γίγας της Κυψέλης’ και φυσικά ‘Το ρεμάλι της Φωκίωνος Νέγρη’.<br /> η Κυψέλη οριοθετείται δυτικά από την οδό Πατησίων, νότια από το Πεδίον του Άρεως, ανατολικά από τα Τουρκοβούνια και βόρεια από τον δήμο Γαλατσίου.

On sunny days, stroll down to St Anne’s Courtyard with a book or join the rest of the city on the leafy setting of Green Park (1",2015-12-26,within an hour,100.0,99.0,0,1,1,51.51352,-0.13127,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,4,1.0,2.0,2.0,"[""Room-darkening shades"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Heating"", ""Smoking allowed"", ""Courtyard view"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Elevator"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Microwave"", ""Self check-in"", ""Wifi"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Cleaning available during stay"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Bed linens"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Hangers"", ""Lockbox"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Shower gel"", ""42\"" HDTV with Amazon Prime Video, Netflix"", ""Iron"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Shampoo"", ""Kitchen"", ""Essentials"", ""Dining table"", ""Free washer \u2013 In unit""]",56,45,6,4.82,4.8,4.79,4.7,4.98,4.91,4.63,1,2,1.83,london,257.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,5.54907608489522,"(51.51352, -0.13127)",7.1230884558159975,19.75286103333124,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,summer,0,0,1,0,0.5

At the top end sits its famous anchor, returned by the council in 2018 after it was mysteriously removed five years earlier, supposedly because it attracted street drinkers (anchors are notorious for this). Over a quarter of a mile, it packs in a street market, a golden-clad library, one of London’s finest baroque churches, lots of Vietnamese restaurants and more history than you can shake a stick at. Stuff changes fast here. Recent years have seen tons of new openings (and a few closings) around the redeveloped Market Yard. A new food market is arriving. Locals fear that SE8’s character will be lost for ever, but – for now – it sails on. Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe, who was murdered in Deptford after quibbling about his bar tab, described ‘infinite riches in a little room’ in ‘The Jew of Malta’, and that just about sums up the high street.
